It's only been 2 days
and I've gotten very little progress done
if only I had others to help me

Are you there?

I can't trust my friends
they tell me I've been in here
for a year. It's only 3 days now

I need sleep
my eyes hurt
I know you're here, watching me

Even my parents say I'm wasting my life
They said I never come out of the room
I do. Every day. Every meal. I came out today
and they said it was 2 years since I've been out.
They said they love me so they haven't kicked me out.

What's going on? Are you real? I know you can read me.

It's just numbers and letters, letters and numbers
There's years.

You know I've been putting the years in order.
But my eyes are deceving me. 1 is 7. 2 is 5. 3 is 8.
They don't make sense. Please help me.

Yesterday I asked you to help me. Where were you?
I need your help. Find the answer. Find the solution.

I'm going to ask my parents for help. Maybe they can help me.
You're not helping me. I need help.

This all seems useless. But I need to solve it.
There's something there. It was burnt. I ran into the fire.
I recovered it. They're hunting me.

I shouldn't have asked my parents. Now they know.
They're watching me. I need rest.

Hello? Are you there? Have you forgotten about me?
I'm right here. I need your help.
Find end. Find what you need.
You need me as much as I need you.
There's too much at risk
They're going to find me.
Find it before they find ..~~--~~__-
