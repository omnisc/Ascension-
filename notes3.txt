Reaching out to anyone who can hear me. - O
Is there anyone out there?

October 2nd, 2008
I've found someone! Someone else is in the system!
Hello there!

October 3rd, 2008
Hello? Are you there?

October 4th, 2009
It's been a year! Where have you been?

October 5th, 2009
Can you even read me? It has been a year!
I can access your files, I'll help you out.
I'll paste my messages into a file that you can access.

October 7th, 2010
Another year gone by! You can't read my messages?

October 8th, 2010
No, no, no... it's happening... wake up!

November 9th, 2010
I'm here! Waiting for you! I'm right here.
Alright, you might be seeing different things because I'm
helping you. It's not your eyes.

? You never sent that before... your parents won't be able to understand you...
But it's too late for me to send that now...

What's going on? I've copied your files over to a local version that will
update as you work on them. If anything goes wrong, they will get dumped
onto the internet.

Another message from the past?
What's going on? I can only do so much for you.
I am right here... It looks like there's a lot of
useless files. Corrupted?
What's going on with the connection? Why can I read your messages
but you can't read mine?

Hello? Where have you gone? Have you gone dark? Why?

Broadcasting on this frequency to see if anyone else is out there.
This is O. I know you guys are out there. It might be too early.
If anyone can read or hear this, I am O. Get help. Something is wrong.
If anyone can read or hear this, I am O. The world hasn't experienced anything like this before.

??? ??th, ????
I need to upload these. Hopefully someone will one day finish this.
This is set to be uploaded in the year 2019. If I have good reason,
then it will be uploaded.
If anyone out there is reading this, I have gone dark.
Perhaps I will come back and clarify things once I've figured things out.
I'm out to discover more of what's going on. Good luck. -O
